- Data cleaning techniques were applied to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Data processing scripts were developed to transform the data into a suitable format for analysis.
- Excel was utilized for data analysis, including calculations, visualizations, and the use of slicers for interactive filtering.

## Data Cleaning
- We checked for null values in each column. In Gender column we there were some inconsistencies so we replaced M with Men and W with Women.
- In QTY column we replaced One with 1.
 Now our Dataset is cleaned.
 
## Data processing
we created a new column Age Group by applying a rule i.e. 
- If age >= 50 then Senior
- If age >= 30 then Adult and 
- If age <30 then Teenager

Now we created a new "Month" column.
